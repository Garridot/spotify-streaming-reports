## About

Spotify Streaming Reports is a Python-based tool that analyzes a user's listening history on Spotify and generates weekly summaries including:

- Listening time breakdown
- Most played artists, genres, and tracks
- Listening trends and variation over time
- Weekly personalized recommendations based on patterns

The project aims to provide insights into your listening habits and help you rediscover music you love.

Spotify Streaming Reports integrates DeepSeek (via OpenRouter) to generate personalized weekly highlights, observations, and music recommendations based on your listening data.

This project uses the model `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free`, which is accessed through the OpenRouter API. The AI analyzes your top genres, artists, and patterns to deliver meaningful insights beyond basic statistics.
